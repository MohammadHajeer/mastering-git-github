# Mastering Git and Github

```
git --version 
```
- The `git --version` outputs the current version of Git that is installed

```
git status
```
- The `git status` command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git.
